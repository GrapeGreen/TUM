### Computer course: Linear Programming

This course explains ways to solve complicated mathematical problems with the aid of computers, in specific Python and Gurobi.

Gurobi is a (proprietary) module to solve problems related to linear, quadratic and mixed integer programming in several coding languages.



#### Python basics

Python is open source (!!!) and easy to learn. It has many useful libraries to tackle high-level elements such as data visualization or graphs.

However, it is slower than other compiled languages. 



#### Linear Programming

Linear programs are in the form $min\ c^Tx\ s. t. Ax \leq b$, with an objective function $c$ over a feasible region (intersection of hyperplanes).

Solving linear programming problems can be done through the simplex method, iterating through edges until the optimal solution is found.
